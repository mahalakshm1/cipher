Cipher Encryption and Decryption

A simple **Python-based cryptography project** that encrypts and decrypts text messages using classic cipher techniques such as the **Caesar Cipher**.  
This project demonstrates basic principles of encryption, string manipulation, and secure message encoding.

 Project Overview
- Implements the **Caesar Cipher algorithm** for text encryption and decryption.  
- Takes user input for the message and shift key.  
- Supports both **encryption** and **decryption** modes.  
- Built using **Python**, focusing on logic and algorithmic thinking.  

Features
.Simple command-line interface
.User-defined shift value for encryption/decryption
.Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
.Demonstrates basic cryptography logic
